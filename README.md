# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

This application uses Google's Gemini models as its primary AI inference engine via the Genkit framework for all generative AI functionalities. All AI-related logic, including prompts and flows, is located in the `src/ai/` directory.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
